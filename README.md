# Mini-Project: Designing for the Elderly
### Overview
Welcome to our mini-project: "Designing for the Elderly." This project focuses on creating a mobile application to support the physical and mental wellbeing of elderly users. Your design should cater to their needs in the current social context, considering factors like social distancing and self-quarantine due to COVID-19.

### Due Date
October 20th

### Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported a significant increase in lifespan over the past decades.
There is a growing need for elderly-friendly technology designs to increase their healthspan.
The elderly demographic shows high variability in technology use and abilities.
The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the reliance on technology for social connections and well-being.
### Objectives
Your task is to design an app for the Quebec Government that aids elderly users in maintaining their physical and mental health. The design should be intuitive, taking into account the diversity in technology skills and potential physical and cognitive limitations of the elderly.

### Guidelines
**Understand the Problem:** Grasp the core issues your design aims to solve. Reflect on the diversity and needs of the elderly.

**Research and Analysis:** Investigate existing applications, their functionalities, and shortcomings. Include user interviews, questionnaires, and other research methods to inform your design.

**User Research:** Adhere to ethical research practices. Utilize the provided ethics consent form for all participant interactions.

**Prototype Creation:** Focus on UX/UI design principles to create sketches, wireframes, and mock-ups. Remember, the goal is a visual prototype, not a functioning one.

### Deliverables
**Hosted Webpage:** Present your case study on a platform like Medium, Github Pages, Blogger, etc. Include:

* Sketches, storyboards, user personas, etc.
* Design iterations, including failed ones.
* Final mock-ups of your design.
  
**Moodle Submission:**

* Link to your webpage.
* A PDF version of the webpage.
