                    The need to improve the quality of life for the senior population is
                    expanding as the population ages. It has been challenging for seniors
                    to adopt technology that might possibly improve their lives due to a
                    lack of applications designed specifically for them. The elderly are
                    an extremely diverse group with more variabilitiy in their abilities
                    than younger groups, hence making it hard to design for them. The
                    Covid-19 pandemic has also had a significant impact on the elderly's
                    ability to keep up social connections and access medical resources.

                <h5 class="paragraph">
                    Our objective is to design an application that enhances the quality of
                    life of seniors by providing them access to resources that supports
                    their physical and mental wellbeing, as well as giving them a way to
                    keep in touch with their families. Our application will provide a
                    user-friendly interface which is adaptable and easy for seniors to
                    use.

                    valuation of $76.23 Billion by the end of 2032. There are currently
                    many apps on the market that are designed for the elderly, here are

                    The elderly are a diverse population with varying levels of technology
                    experience and comfort. Some may have little knowledge and find
                    technology difficult to use, while some may be tech-savvy and use a
                    variety of technological devices. We conducted a survey to gather
                    feedback from elderly people and understand their preferences and
                    needs when it comes to using technology.This will help us in
                    developing an app that is more inclusive, accessible, and
                    user-friendly.
